# Breif summary of the project:
This project is a voice translator that enables real-time translation of spoken language from one language to another.

 It utilizes various technologies such as speech recognition,googletrans,PyAudio,gTTS and machine translation to facilitate seamless communication across different languages.

 voice translatorscapture spoken language through a microphone or audio input and convertg it into text using speech recognition algorithms. 

 The recognized text is then translated into the desired language using machine translation techniques. Finally, the translated text can be converted back into spoken language using google text-to-speech synthesis, allowing the user to hear the translated output.

 # python Library  used:
 googletrans(Google Translate API)

 PyAudio

 speech_recognition

 gTTS

 # How to use it:

 simply open our software(Visual studio code) after open our terminal.

 To use the code, simply click the "Run" button. It will display "Speak now" on the terminal you to speak into the microphone of your PC.
  
 After speaking, the code will convert the spoken text into the desired language for translation.
